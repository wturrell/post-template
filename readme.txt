Requires at least: 4.7.2
Tested up to: 4.7.2

A plugin that allows you to create and use templates in order to facilitate writing of similar posts/pages.

== Description ==

It happens quite often that a blogger publishes posts or static pages on a regular basis which have the same structure. Think about for example a "picture of the day" daily post. With current wordpress state, we need to spend a lot of time doing copy/paste between posts instead of actually writing content. 

All the instructions for installation, the support forums, etc. can be found on the [plugin home page](http://www.marvinlabs.com).

== Screenshots ==
